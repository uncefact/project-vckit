## Github Issues

RFCs that are not on the brink of changing status are discussed through Github Issues.
We generally use Issues to discuss changes that are controversial, and PRs to propose
changes that are vetted. This keeps the PR backlog small.

Any community member can open an issue; specify the RFC number in the issue title so
the relationship is clear. For example, to open an issue on RFC 0025, an appropriate
title for the issue might be:

    RFC 0025: Need better diagram in Reference section

When the community feels that it's reasonable to suggest a formal status change for
an RFC, best efforts are made to resolve all open issues against it. Then a PR is
raised against the RFC's main README.md, where the status field in the header is
updated. Discussion about the status change typically takes place in the comment
stream for the PR, with issues being reserved for non-status-change topics.
