## Summary

This RFC describes a simple, standard notation for various concepts related to decentralized and self-sovereign identity (SSI).

The notation could be used in design docs, other RFCs, source code comments, chat channels, scripts, debug logs, and miscellaneous technical materials throughout the Aries ecosystem. We hope it is also used in the larger SSI community.

This RFC is complementary to official terms like the ones curated in the [TOIP Concepts and Terminology Working group](https://trustoverip.org/working-groups/concepts-and-terminology/), the [Sovrin Glossary]( https://sovrin.org/library/glossary/), and so forth.

## Motivation

All technical materials in our ecosystem hinge on fundamental concepts of self-sovereign identity such as controllers, keys, [DIDs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/), and [agents](../0004-agents/README.md). We need a standard, documented notation to refer to such things, so we can use it consistently, and so we can link to the notation's spec for definitive usage.

## Tutorial

The following explanation is meant to be read sequentially and should provide a friendly overview for most who encounter the RFC. See the [Reference section](#reference) for quick lookup.

## Requirements

This notation aims to be:

* Precise
* Consistent
* Terse
* Easy to learn, understand, guess, and remember
* Representable in 7-bit ASCII plain text

The final requirement deserves special comment. Cryptologists are a major stakeholder in SSI theory. They already have many notational conventions, some more standardized than others. Generally, their notation derives from advanced math and uses specialized symbols and fonts. These experts also tend to intersect strongly with academic circles, where LaTeX and similar rendering technologies are common.

Despite the intersection between SSI, cryptology, and academia, SSI has to serve a broader audience. Its practicioners are not just mathematicians; they may include support and IT staff, lawyers specializing in intellectual property, business people, auditors, regulators, and individuals sometimes called "end users." In particular, SSI ecosystems are built and maintained by coders. Coders regularly write docs in markdown and html. They interact with one another on chat. They write emails and source code where comments might need to be embedded. They create UML diagrams. They type in shells. They paste code into slide decks and word processors. All of these behaviors militate against a notation that requires complex markup.

Instead, we want something simple, clean, and universally supported. Hence the 7-bit ASCII requirement. A future version of this RFC, or an addendum to it, might explain how to map this 7-bit ASCII notation to various schemes that use mathematical symbols and are familiar to experts from other fields.

### Solution

#### Controllers and Subjects

An identified thing (the referent of an identifier) is called an __identity subject__. Identity subjects can include:
 
 * passive things (pets, digital documents, symphonies, rivers, asteroids, strains of bacteria...)
 * active things (people, institutions, IoT devices)
 
The latter category may also act as an __identity controller__ -- something that projects its intent with respect to identity onto the digital landscape.

When an identity controller controls its own identity, we say that it has __self sovereignty__ -- and we call it a __self__. (The term __identity owner__ was originally used for an identity controller managing itself, but this hid some of the nuance and introduced [legal concepts of ownership that are problematic](https://medium.com/@hackylawyER/do-we-really-want-to-sell-ourselves-the-risks-of-a-property-law-paradigm-for-data-ownership-b217e42edffa), so we'll avoid it here.)
 
In our notation, selves (or identity controllers) are denoted with a single *upper-case* ASCII alpha, often corresponding to a first initial of their human-friendly name. For example, Alice might be represented as `A`. By preference, the first half of the alphabet is used (because "x", "y", and "z" tend to have other ad-hoc meanings). When reading aloud, the spoken form of a symbol like this is the name of the letter. The relevant [ABNF]( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234) fragment is:

 ```ABNF
  ucase-alpha    = %x41-5A            ; A-Z
  lcase-alpha    = %x61-7A            ; a-z
  digit          = %x30-39            ; 0-9

  self = ucase-alpha
  ```

Identity subjects that are not self-controlled are referenced in our notation using a single *lower-case* ASCII alpha. For example, a movie might be `m`. For clarity in scenarios where multiple subjects are referenced, it is best to choose letters that differ in something other than case.

```ABNF
  controlled = lcase-alpha

  subject = self / controlled
```

The set of devices, keys, endpoints, data, and other resources controlled by or for a given subject is called the subject's __identity domain__ (or just __domain__ for short). When the controller is a self, the domain is __self-sovereign__; otherwise, the domain is __controlled__. Either way, the domain of an identity subject is like its private universe, so the name or symbol of a subject is often used to denote its domain as well; context eliminates ambiguity. You will see examples of this below.

#### Association

Elements associated with a domain are named in a way that makes their association clear, using a `name@context` pattern familiar from email addresses: `1@A` (“one at A”) is agent 1 in A’s sovereign domain. (Note how we use an erstwhile identity owner symbol, `A`, to reference a domain here, but there is no ambiguity.) This fully qualified form of a subject reference is useful for clarification but is often not necessary.

In addition to domains, this same associating notation may be used where a _relationship_ is the context, because sometimes the association is to the relationship rather than to a participant. See the DID example in the next section.

#### Agents

Agents are not subjects. They neither control or own a domain; rather, they live and act within it. They take instructions from the domain's controller. Agents ([and hubs, and other things like them](../0004-agents/README.md#the-agent-ness-continuum)) are the first example of elements associated with an identity subject. Despite this, agent-ish things are the primary focus of interactions within SSI ecosystems.

Additionally, agents are distinct from devices, even though we often (and inaccurately) used them interchangeably. We may say things like "Alice's iPhone sends a message" when we more precisely mean "the agent on Alice's iPhone sends a message." In reality, there may be zero, one, or more than one agents running on a particular device.

Agents are numbered and are represented by up to three digits and then with an association. In most discussions, one digit is plenty, but three digits are allowed so agents can be conveniently grouped by prefix (e.g., all edge agents in Alice's domain might begin with `1`, and all cloud might begin with `2`).

  ```ABNF
  agent = 1*3digit "@" subject
  ```

#### Devices

Devices are another element inside a subject's domain. They are represented with two or more lower-case ASCII alphanumerics or underscore characters, where the first char cannot be a digit. They end with an association: `bobs_car@B`, `drone4@F`, `alices_iphone9@A`.

  ```ABNF
  name-start-char = lcase-alpha / "_"            ; a-z or underscore
  name-other-char = digit / lcase-alpha / "_"    ; 0-9 or a-z or underscore
  device = name-start-char 1*name-other-char "@" subject
  ```

### Cross-Domain Relationships

#### Short Form (more common)

Alice’s pairwise relationship with Bob is represented with colon notation: `A:B`. This is read aloud as “A to B” (preferred because it’s short; alternatives such as “the A B relationship” or “A colon B” or “A with respect to B” are also valid). When written in the other order, it represents the same relationship as seen from Bob’s point of view. Note that passive subjects may also participate in relationships: `A:bobs_car`. (Contrast [Intra-Domain Relationships](#intra-domain-relationships) below.)

N-wise relationships (e.g., doctor, hospital, patient) are written with the perspective-governing subject's identifier, a single colon, then by all other identifiers for members of the relationship, in alphabetical order, separated by `+`: `A:B+C`, `B:A+C`. This is read aloud as in "A to B plus C."

  ```ABNF
  next-subject = "+" subject
  short-relationship = subject ":" subject *next-subject
  ```

#### Long Form

Short form is convenient and brief, but it is inconsistent because each party to the relationship describes it differently. Sometimes this may be undesirable, so a long and consistent form is also supported. The long form of both pairwise and N-way relationships lists all participants to the right of the colon, in alphabetical order. Thus the long forms of the Alice to Bob relationship might be `A:A+B` (for Alice's view of this relationship) and `B:A+B` (for Bob's view). For a doctor, hospital, patient relationship, we might have `D:D+H+P`, `H:D+H+P`, and `P:D+H+P`. Note how the enumeration of parties to the right of the colon is consistent.

Long form and short form are allowed to vary freely; any tools that parses this notation should treat them as synonyms and stylistic choices only.

The ABNF for long form is identical to short form, except that we are guaranteed that after the colon, we will see at least two parties and one `+` character:

  ```ABNF
  long-relationship = subject ":" subject 1*next-subject
  ```

#### Generalized Relationships

##### Contexts
Some models for SSI emphasize the concept of __personas__ or __contexts__. These are essentially "masks" that an identity controller enables, exposing a limited subset of the subject's identity to an audience that shares that context. For example, Alice might assume one persona in her employment relationships, another for government interactions, another for friends, and another when she's a customer.

Contexts or personas can be modeled as a relationship with a generalized audience: `A:Work`, `A:Friends`.

  ```ABNF
  general-audience = ucase-alpha 1*name-other-char
  general-relationship = subject ":" general-audience
  relationship = short-relationship / long-relationship / general-relationship
  ```

##### Any

The concept of public DIDs suggests that someone may think about a relationship as unbounded, or as not varying no matter who the other subject is. For example, a company may create a public DID and advertise it to the world, intending for this connection point to begin relationships with customers, partners, and vendors alike. While best practice suggests that such relationships be used with care, and that they primarily serve to bootstrap pairwise relationships, the notation still needs to represent the possibility.

The [token `Any` is reserved](#reserved-tokens) for these semantics. If Acme Corp is represented as `A`, then Acme's public persona could be denoted with `A:Any`. When `Any` is used, it is never the subject whose perspective is captured; it is always a faceless "other". This means that `Any` appears only on the right side of a colon in a relationship, and it probably doesn't make sense to combine it with other participants since it would subsume them all.

##### Self

It is sometimes useful to model a relationship with onesself. This is done with the reserved token `Self`.

### Intra-Domain Relationships

Within a domain, relationships among agents or devices is sometimes interesting. Such relationships use the `~` (tilde) character. Thus, the intra-domain relationship between Alice's agent 1 and agent 2 is written `1~2` and read as "one tilde two".

### Constituents

Items that belong to a domain rather than having independent identity of their own (for example, data, money, keys) use dot notation for containment or ownership: `A.ls`, (A’s link secret), `A.policy`, etc.

Names for constituents use the same rules as names for agents and devices.

Alice’s DID for her relationship with Bob is an inert constituent datum, but it is properly associated with the relationship rather than just Alice. It is thus represented with `A.did@A:B`. (The [token `did` is reserved](#reserved-tokens) for DIDs). This is read as “A’s DID at A to B”. Bob’s complementary DID would be `B.did@B:A`.

  ```ABNF
  inert = name-start-char 1*name-other-char
  nested = "." inert
  owned-inert = subject 1*nested

  associated-to = identity-owner / relationship
  associated = subject 0*nested "@" associated-to
  ```

If `A` has a cloud agent `2`, then the public key (verification key or verkey) and private, secret key (signing key or sigkey) used by `2` in `A:B` would be: `2.pk@A:B` and `2.sk@A:B`. This is read as “2 dot P K at A to B” and “2 dot S K at A to B”. Here, `2` is known to belong to `A` because it takes `A`’s perspective on `A:B`--it would be equivalent but unnecessary to write `A.2.pk@A:B`.

### DID Docs and DID References

The mention of keys belonging to agents naturally raises the question of DID docs and the things they contain. How do they relate to our notation?
 
[DIDs are designed to be URIs]( https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#generic-did-syntax), and items that carry an `id` property within a DID Doc [can be referenced with standard URI fragment notation]( https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#fragments). This allows someone, for example, to refer to the first public key used by one of the agents owned by Alice with a notation like: `did:sov:VUrvFeWW2cPv9hkNZ2ms2a;#key1`.

This notation is important and useful, but it is somewhat orthogonal to the concerns of this RFC. In the context of SSI notation, we are not DID-centric; we are subject centric, and subject are identified by a single capital alpha instead of by their DID. This helps with brevity. It lets us ignore the specific DID value and instead focus on the higher level semantics; compare:

<blockquote><code>{A.did@A:B}/B --> B</code></blockquote>

...to:

<blockquote><code>did:sov:PXqKt8sVsDu9T7BpeNqBfe</code> sends its DID for
<code>did:sov:6tb15mkMRagD7YA3SBZg3p</code> to
<code>did:sov:6tb15mkMRagD7YA3SBZg3p</code>,
using the agent possessing <code>did:sov:PXqKt8sVsDu9T7BpeNqBfe;#key1</code>
to encrypt with the corresponding signing key.</blockquote>

We expect DID reference notation (the verbose text above) to be relevant for concrete communication between computers, and SSI notation (the terse equivalent shown first) to be more convenient for symbolic, higher level discussions between human beings. Occasionally, we may get very specific and map SSI notation into DID notation (e.g., `A.1.vk = did:sov:PXqKt8sVsDu9T7BpeNqBfe;#key1`).

### Counting and Iteration

Sometimes, a concept or value evolves over time. For example, a given discussion might need to describe a DID Doc or an endpoint or a key across multiple state changes. In mathematical notation, this would typically be modeled with subscripts. In our notation, we use square brackets, and we number beginning from zero. `A.pk[0]@A:B` would be the first pubkey used by A in the `A:B` relationship; `A.pk[1]@A:B` would be the second pubkey, and so on. Likewise, a sequence of messages could be represented with `msg[0]`, `msg[1]`, and `msg[2]`.

### Messages

Messages are represented as quoted string literals, or with the [reserved token](#reserved-tokens) `msg`, or with kebab-case names that explain their semantics, as in `cred-offer`:

```ABNF
string-literal = %x22 c-literal %x22
kebab-char = lcase-alpha / digit
kebab-suffix = "-" 1*hint-char
kebab-msg = 1*kebab-char *kebab-suffix
message = "msg" / string-literal / kebab-msg
```

### Payments

Economic activity is part of rich SSI ecosystems, and requires notation. A __payment address__ is denoted with the [`pay` reserved token](#reserved-tokens); `A.pay[4]` would be A's fifth payment address. The public key and secret key for a payment address use the [`ppk` and `psk` reserved token](#reserved-tokens), respectively. Thus, one way to reference the payment keys for that payment address would be `A.pay[4].ppk` and `A.pay[4].psk`. (Keys are normally held by agents, not by people--and every agent has its own keys. Thus, another notation for the public key pertaining to this address might be `A.1.pay[4].ppk`. This is an area of clumsiness that needs further study.)

### Encryption

Encryption deserves special consideration in the SSI world. It often figures prominently in discussions about security and privacy, and our notation needs to be able to represent it carefully.

The following crypto operations are recognized by the notation, without making a strong claim about how the operations are implemented. (For example, inline Diffie Helman and an ephemeral symmetric key might be used for the *_crypt algorithms. What is interesting to the notation isn't the low-level details, but the general semantics achieved.)

* `anon_crypt(msg, recipient_pubkey)` -- Encrypt only for recipient, achieving confidentiality. Sender is anonymous. Parties may have had no prior contact, though sender must discover recipient's pubkey. The message is tamper evident.

* `auth_crypt(msg, recipient_pubkey, sender_privkey)` -- Encrypt only for recipient, achieving confidentiality. Recipient learns sender’s pubkey but can’t prove to anybody else who the sender is (making the message repudiable). Parties may have had no prior contact, though sender must discover recipient's pubkey. The message is tamper evident.

* `sign(msg, signer_privkeys)` -- Associate a signature with a message, making the message [non-repudiable](../0049-repudiation/README.md). This also makes the message tamper-evident. A signature does not automatically encrypt and therefore is not a way to achieve confidentiality. Note that complex signature schemes (multisig, M of N, ring) use this operation as well.

* `verify(msg, signature, signer_pubkeys)` -- Verify a signature over a message with select keys. Note that complex verification schemes (multiverify, M of N, ring) use this operation as well.

* `sym_crypt(msg, sym_key)` -- Symmetrically encrypt for anyone who has the symmetric key, achieving a limited form of confidentiality. Key must be shared in advance with both parties. Likely tamper evident. If multiple parties know the symmetric key, the sender is not knowable to the recipient.

The notation for these crypto primitives uses curly braces around the message, with suffixes to clarify semantics. Generally, it identifies a recipient as an identity owner or thing, without clarifying the key that's used--the pairwise key for their DID is assumed.

```ABNF
asymmetric   = "/"                                   ; suffix
symmetric    = "*"                                   ; suffix
sign         = "#"                                   ; suffix
multiplex    = "%"                                   ; suffix
verify       = "?"                                   ; suffix

anon-crypt   = "{" message "}" asymmetric subject          ; e.g., {"hi"}/B

                ; sender is first subject in relationship, receiver is second
auth-crypt   = "{" message "}" asymmetric short-relationship ; e.g., {"hi"}/A:B

sym-crypt    = "{" message "}" symmetric subject           ; e.g., {"hi"}*B

verify       = "{" message "}" verify subject              ; e.g., {"hi"}?B
```

The relative order of suffixes reflects whether encryption or signing takes place first: `{"hello"}*B#` says that symmetric encryption happens first, and then a signature is computed over the cypertext; `{"hello"#}*B` says that plaintext is signed, and then both the plaintext and the signature are encrypted. (The `{"hello"}#*B` variant is nonsensical because it splits the encryption notation in half).

All suffixes can be further decorated with a parenthesized algorithm name, if precision is required: `{"hello"}*(aes256)B` or `{"hello"}/(rsa1024)A:B` or `{"hello"#(ecdsa)}/B`.

With signing, usually the signer and sender are assumed to be identical, and the notation omits any clarification about the signer. However, this can be added after `#` to be explicit. Thus, `{msg#B}/C` would be a message with plaintext signed by B, anon-encrypted for C. Similarly, `{msg#(ring-rabin)BGJM}/A:C` would be a message with plaintext signed according to a Rabin ring signature algorithm, by B, G, J, and M, and then auth-encrypted by A for C.

Signing verification would be over the corresponding message and which entities perform the action. `{msg#A}?B` would be a message with plaintext signed by A verified by B. `{msg#(threshold-sig)ABC}?DE` would be a plaintext message signed according to a threshold signature algorithm by A, B, C and then verified by D and E.

Multiplexed asymmetric encryption is noted above, but has not yet been described. This is a technique whereby a message body is encrypted with an ephemeral symmetric key, and then the ephemeral key is encrypted asymmetrically for multiple potential recipients (each of which has a unique but tiny payload [the key] to decrypt, which in turn unlocks the main payload). The notation for this looks like `{msg}%BCDE` for multiplexed anon\_crypt (sender is anonymous), and like `{msg}%A:BCDE` for multiplexed auth\_crypt (sender is authenticated by their private key).

### Other punctuation

Message sending is represented with arrows: `->` is most common, though `<-` is also reasonable in some cases. Message content and notes about sending can be embedded in the hyphens of sending arrow, as in this example, where the notation says an unknown party uses http to transmit "hello", anon-enrcypted for Alice:

  ```<unknown> -- http: {"hello"}/A --> 1```

Parentheses have traditional meaning (casual usage in written language, plus grouping and precedence).

Angle braces `<` and `>` are for placeholders; any reasonable explanatory text may appear inside the angle braces, so to represent Alice's relationship with a not-yet-known subject, the notation might show something like `A:<TBD>`.

## Drawbacks

* Creates one more formalism to learn. SSI is already a dense topic with a steep learning curve.
* Creates something that needs to be version-controlled.

## Rationale and alternatives

- Could use informal verbiage instead. However, it would be inconsistent and poorly documented.

## Prior art

* [LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) provides powerful
and beautiful rendering of complex formal concepts, and uses escape sequences that are
pure ASCII. There is a [JVM-based parser/renderer for Latex](
https://sourceforge.net/projects/jlatex/); perhaps similar things exist for other
programming languages as well.

    However, LaTeX has drawbacks. It focuses on rendering,
    not on the semantics behind what's rendered. In
    this respect, it is a bit like HTML 1.0 before CSS--you can bold or underline,
    but you're usually encoding what something looks like, not what it means. (LaTeX
    does support logical styles and sections, but this introduces far more complexity
    than we need.)

    The LaTeX snippet ```e^{-x_y}``` should render like this:

    ![e^{-x_y} rendered by LaTeX engine](expression.png)

    This is great--but it doesn't say anything about what `e`, `x`, and `y` _mean_. Thus a LaTeX
    solution would still have to define conventions for meaning in a separate spec.
    These conventions would have to find representations that are not obvious
    (LaTeX recommends no particular rendering for encryption functions, keys,
    ownership, association). And such a spec would have to be careful not to
    ascribe meaning to a rendering that conflicts with assumptions of
    knowledgeable LaTeX users (e.g., using `\sqrt` for something other than
    its mathematical square root function in the vocabulary would raise eyebrows).

    Highly formatted LaTeX is also quite verbose.

    A very simple form of LaTeX could be used (e.g., just superscripts and subscripts)--
    but this would have to solve some of the problems mentioned below, in the
    DKMS section.

* [ASCIIMath](http://asciimath.org/) has many of the same benefits and drawbacks as
LaTeX. It is less ubiquitous.

* The key management notation introduced in "[DKMS (Decentralized Key Management
System) V3](http://bit.ly/dkmsv3)" overlaps significantly with the concerns of this notation (render [this
diagram](
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/677a0439487a1b7ce64c2e62671ed3e0079cc11f/doc/design/005-dkms/08-add-connection-private-did-provisioned.puml
) for an example). However, it does not encompass all the concerns
explored here, so it would have to be expanded before it could be complete.



  Also, experiments with superscripts and subscripts in this format led to semantic
  dead ends or undesirable nesting when patterns were applied consistently. For
  example, one thought had us representing Alice's verkey, signing key, and DID for her
  Bob relationship with A<sub>B</sub><sup>VK</sup>, A<sub>B</sub><sup>SK</sup>.
  and A<sub>B</sub><sup>DID</sup>. This was fine until we asked how to represent
  the verkey for Alice's agent in the Alice to Bob relationship; is that
  A<sub>B</sub><sup>DID<sup>VK</sup></sup>? And what about Alice's link secret, that
  isn't relationship-specific? And how would we handle N-way relationships?

## Unresolved questions

* Do we need to support non-ASCII characters in the notation? (I suggest no--for coders
  wishing to share simple algebra-like notes in comments or on chat, ASCII is a reasonable
  least-common denominator usable with any keyboard or natural language. Adding more complicates
  too many things.)
* Do we need special notation for credentials, proofs, and the like? If so, how does
  this relate to ZKLang?
* Do we need notation for security contexts of messages?
