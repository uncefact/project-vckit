## Summary

Explains how one party can request an acknowledgment to and clarify the status of processes.

## Motivation

An **acknowledgment** or **ACK** is one of the most common procedures in protocols
of all types. The ACK message is defined in Aries RFC [0015-acks](../0015-acks/README.md) and is adopted into other protocols for use at explicit points in the execution of a protocol. In addition to receiving ACKs at predefined places in a protocol, agents also need the ability to request additional ACKs at other points in an instance of a protocol. Such requests may or may not be answered by the other party, hence the "please" in the name of decorator.

## Tutorial

If you are not familiar with the [tutorial section of the ACK message](../0015-acks/README.md#tutorial),please review that first.

Agents interact in very complex ways. They may use multiple transport mechanisms,
across varied protocols, through long stretches of time. While we usually expect
messages to arrive as sent, and to be processed as expected, a vital tool in the
agent communication repertoire is the ability to request and receive
acknowledgments to confirm a shared understanding.

### Requesting an ack (`~please_ack`)

A protocol may stipulate that an ack is always necessary in certain circumstances.
Launch mechanics for spacecraft do this, because the stakes for a miscommunication
are so high. In such cases, there is no need to request an ack, because it is
hard-wired into the protocol definition. However, acks make a channel more chatty,
and in doing so they may lead to more predictability and correlation for
point-to-point communications. Requiring an ack is not always the right choice.
For example, an ack should probably be optional at the end of credential issuance
("I've received your credential. Thanks.") or proving ("I've received your proof,
and it satisfied me. Thanks.").

In addition, circumstances at a given moment may make an ad hoc ack desirable even
when it would normally NOT be needed. Suppose Alice likes to bid at online auctions.
Normally she may submit a bid and be willing to wait for the auction to unfold
organically to see the effect. But if she's bidding on a high-value item and
is about to put her phone in airplane mode because her plane's ready to take off,
she may want an immediate ACK that the bid was accepted.

The dynamic need for acks is expressed with the `~please_ack` message [decorator](../../concepts/0011-decorators/README.md). An example of the decorator looks like this:

```json
{
  "~please_ack": {
    "on": ["RECEIPT"]
  }
}
```

This says, "Please send me an ack as soon as you receive this message."

### Examples

Suppose AliceCorp and Bob are involved in credential issuance. Alice is an issuer;
Bob wants to hold the issued credential.

#### On Receipt

In the final required message of the `issue-credential` protocol, AliceCorp sends
the credential to Bob. But AliceCorp wants to know for sure that Bob has received it,
for its own accounting purposes. So it decorates the final message with an ack
request:

```json
{
  "~please_ack": {
    "on": ["RECEIPT"]
  }
}
```

Bob honors this request and returns an `ack` as soon as he receives it and stores its payload.

#### On Outcome

Same as with the previous example, AliceCorp wants an acknowledgement from Bob. However, in contrast to the previous example that just requests an acknowledgement on receipt of message, this time AliceCorp wants to know for sure Bob verified the validity of the credential. To do this AliceCorp decorates the `issue-credential` message with an ack request for the `OUTCOME`.

```json
{
  "~please_ack": {
    "on": ["OUTCOME"]
  }
}
```

Bob honors this request and returns an `ack` as soon as he has verified the validity of the issued credential.

## Reference

### `~please_ack` decorator

#### **`on`**

The only field for the please ack decorator. Required array. Describes the circumstances under which an ack is desired. Possible values in this array include `RECEIPT` and `OUTCOME`.

If both values are present, it means an acknowledgement is requested for both the receipt and outcome of the message

##### `RECEIPT`

The `RECEIPT` acknowledgement is the easiest ack mechanism and requests that an ack is sent on receipt of the message. This way of requesting an ack is to verify whether the other agent successfully received the message. It implicitly means the agent was able to unpack the message, to see

##### `OUTCOME`

The `OUTCOME` acknowledgement is the more advanced ack mechanism and requests that an ack is sent on outcome of the message. By default outcome means the message has been handled and processed without business logic playing a role in the decision.

In the context of the issue credential protocol, by default, this would mean an ack is requested as soon as the received credentials is verified to be valid. It doesn't mean the actual contents of the credential are acknowledged. For the issue credential protocol it makes more sense to send the acknowledgement after the contents of the credential have also been verified.

Therefore protocols can override the definition of outcome in the context of that protocol. Examples of protocols overriding this behavior are [Issue Credential Protocol 2.0](../0453-issue-credential-v2/README.md), [Present Proof Protocol 2.0](../0454-present-proof-v2/README.md) and [Revocation Notification Protocol 1.0](../0183-revocation-notification/README.md)

## Drawbacks

None specified.

## Rationale and alternatives

The first version of this RFC was a lot more advanced, but also introduced a lot of complexities. A lot of complex features have been removed so it could be included in AIP 2.0 in a simpler form. More advanced features [from the initial RFC](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/2e6007b224f6888aec79b20bbddea3c4d533042a/features/0317-please-ack/README.md) can be added back in when needed.

## Prior art

None specified.

## Unresolved questions

- Security and privacy implications of `~please_ack` decorators. Could they be used to mount a denial-of-service attack or to sniff info that's undesirable?
- Signed (Non-repudiable) acks. How do you ask for an ACK that commits its sender to the acknowledgment in a way that's provable to third parties?
- Multiplexed acks. How do you ask for, and supply, an ACK to all of Alice's agents instead of just to the one who sent the ACK? Does each agent need to request the ACK separately? Are there denial-of-service or other security issues?

## Implementations

The following lists the implementations (if any) of this RFC. Please do a pull request to add your implementation. If the implementation is open source, include a link to the repo or to the implementation within the repo. Please be consistent in the "Name" field so that a mechanical processing of the RFCs can generate a list of all RFCs supported by an Aries implementation.
