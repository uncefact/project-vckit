## Summary

Describes the prerequisites a verifier must ensure are in place before requesting
a rich presentation.

## Motivation

To inform verifiers of the steps they should take in order to make sure they
have the necessary rich schema objects in place before they use them to request
proofs.

## Tutorial

### Rich Schema Presentation Definition Workflow 
1. The verifier checks his wallet or the ledger to see if the presentation
definition already exists. (The verifier determines which attribute or
predicates he needs a holder to present to satisfy the verifier's business
rules. Presentation definitions specify desired attributes and predicates).
   1. If not, the verifier creates a new presentation definition and stores the
   presentation definition in his wallet locally and, optionally, anchors it to
   the verifiable data registry. (Anchoring the presentation definition to the
   verifiable data registry allows other verifiers to easily use it. It can be done by writing the full presentation definition's content to the ledger, or just writing a digital fingerprint/hash of the content.)
1. Using the presentation definition, request a presentation from the holder.
The [Present Proof Protocol 1.0](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0037-present-proof)
will be the model for another RFC containing minor modifications for presenting
a proof based on verifiable credentials using the new rich schema objects.
