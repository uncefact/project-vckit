## Summary

A protocol to share and request changes to policy that relates to message transfer.

## Motivation

Explicit Policy Enables clear expectations.

## Tutorial

### Roles

**policy_holder** uses the policy to manage messages directed to the _recipient_.
**recipient** the agent the policy relates to.

## Reference

### Policy Publish
Used to share current policy by policy holder.
This can be sent unsolicited or in response to a `policy_share_request`.
```json=
{
    "@id": "123456781",
    "@type": "https://didcomm.org/transferpolicy/1.0/policy",
    "queue_max_duration": 86400,
    "message_count_limit": 1000,
    "message_size_limit": 65536,
    "queue_size_limit": 65536000,
    "pickup_allowed": true,
    "delivery_retry_count_limit":5,
    "delivery_retry_count_seconds":86400,
    "delivery_retry_backoff": "exponential"
}
```
### Policy Share Request
Used to ask for a `policy` message to be sent.
```json=

{
    "@id": "123456781",
    "@type": "https://didcomm.org/transferpolicy/1.0/policy_share_request"
}
```

### Policy Change Request
Sent to request a policy change. The expected response is a `policy` message.

```json=

{
    "@id": "123456781",
    "@type": "https://didcomm.org/transferpolicy/1.0/policy_change_request",
        "queue_max_duration": 86400,
    "message_count_limit": 1000,
    "message_size_limit": 65536,
    "queue_size_limit": 65536000,
    "pickup_allowed": true,
    "delivery_retry_count_limit":5,
    "delivery_retry_count_seconds":86400,
    "delivery_retry_backoff": "exponential"
}
```
Only attributes that you desire to change need to be included.


## Prior art
Concepts here borrow heavily from a [document](https://hackmd.io/@8VtAqKThQ6mKa9T7JgzIaw/SJw9Ead2N?type=view) written by Andrew Whitehead of BCGov.

## Unresolved questions

- Is the attribute list too extensive for a first pass?
- Which policy attributes should be required? Which optional?
  
## Implementations

The following lists the implementations (if any) of this RFC. Please do a pull request to add your implementation. If the implementation is open source, include a link to the repo or to the implementation within the repo. Please be consistent in the "Name" field so that a mechanical processing of the RFCs can generate a list of all RFCs supported by an Aries implementation.
