## What is VCkit

A reference implementation of a verifiable credentials platform for digital trade and traceability. Please review this [verifiable credentials white paper](https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2022-07/WhitePaper_VerifiableCredentials-CBT.pdf) to understand the business context for this work.

## Who is VCkit for?

* If you are an organisation that issues any kind of credential such as a permit, certificate, accreditation, license, or other "claim" of value to your community or constituency, then this project is for you. VCkit provides the tools to equip your existing business systems with the ability to issue your existing credentials as high integrity, standards based, and interoperable VCs that your constituents (VC holders) can present to any party that needs to verify them.

* VCs issued by VCkit tooling can be verified using any mobile device camera to scan a QR code. This is important so that uptake can remain compatible with today's paper processes. There is no requirement for verifiers of credentials to adopt any new new technology in order to verify a credential. However, if you are an organisation that is likely to be verifying at scale or you wish to extract the digital data in a credential for use in your business systems then VCkit is also for you. It provides an advanced multi-protocol verification capability that can be integrated with your systems.

## Why VCkit

* **Open Source**: VCkit is open source software, meaning it's free to use, modify, and distribute. You can customize it to your needs, and it's constantly being improved by a community of developers.
* **Interoperable**: Our goal is to facilitate interoperability among diverse international trade stakeholders by enabling seamless integration with existing systems and standards, streamlining processes, increasing efficiency, and promoting trust and transparency in transactions.
* **Built on Open Standards**: Built on open standards, VCkit ensures compatibility with established technologies, protocols, and frameworks, enabling seamless integration, enhancing interoperability, and promoting innovation in the international trade ecosystem.
