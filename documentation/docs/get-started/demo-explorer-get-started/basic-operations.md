# Basic Operations

:::info
To try this locally, you need to create a secure tunnel to your `localhost:3332`. You can use [**ngrok**](/docs/get-started/api-server-get-started/basic-operations#optional-using-https-for-localhost-by-using-ngrok) to do this.
:::

## Create an identifier

First of all, you need to create an **identifier**. To do it, visit this URL [`http://localhost:3000/managed-identifiers`](http://localhost:3000/managed-identifiers).

### Step 1

Click **Create New Identifier** button.

### Step 2

Give it an example alias, in this case it's the [**ngrok**](/docs/get-started/api-server-get-started/basic-operations#optional-using-https-for-localhost-by-using-ngrok) custom domain which is connected to `localhost:3332`. Then select the did type, in this case we use **did:web**. Then click **Save**

## Issue a Verifiable Credential

Visit this URL [`http://localhost:3000/developer/credential-from-schema`](http://localhost:3000/developer/credential-from-schema) to issue a VC.

### Step 1

1. Select the VC schema from the dropdown.
2. Add Credential subject.
3. Select proof format
4. Select the issuer (the identifier you created at previous step)
5. Click Issue button.

### Step 2

Go to [**Credential**](http://localhost:3000/credentials) page to see the list of issued VC. Here you can download the VC, and verify it in the next step.

You can also see the details of the VC. At Rendered tab, you can see the rendered version of it, this is made by the [Renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vckit/renderer) plugin of VCkit.

:::note
The QR code won't work due to being on localhost, and it's not a result of rendering.

## Verify a VC

Go to [**Credential verifier**](http://localhost:3000/credential-verifier) page to verify a VC. You can upload the VC that you downloaded previously here to verify it.
This is the expected result.

2. Select the VC that you want to revoke.
3. Select tab **Info**
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and click **Revoke**
