# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Clone [VCkit](https://github.com/uncefact/project-vckit.git) repository
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 20.12.2
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) version 8.14.1
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) version 1.22.22
- Make sure you have the API server started on local. See how to do it [here](/docs/get-started/api-server-get-started/installation).

:::warning
**Notice**: You should install the pnpm package manager globally on your machine by using the npm package manager. You can install pnpm by running the following command: `npm install -g pnpm@8.14.1`. Using [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) to install pnpm that will have some conflicts with the project dependencies that are using yarn package manager to install and build.
:::

This project has been tested and optimized for Node.js version v20.12.2 and pnpm version 8.14.1. Please note that using a Node.js version later than v20.12.2 may result incorrect functionality and potential bugs. It is strongly recommended to use these specific versions for running and testing the project. Deviating from these versions may result in unforeseen compatibility issues or unexpected behavior.

## Install dependencies

Let's install the dependencies of this project by running this command.

```bash
cd project-vckit & pnpm install
```

## Create env file

Create a new .env file at `packages/demo-explorer/.env`, and copy the content of `packages/demo-explorer/.env.example` into it.

```bash
cp packages/demo-explorer/.env.example packages/demo-explorer/.env
```

## Env variables

`REACT_APP_ENCRYPTED_ENDPOINT` - The endpoint to encrypt the data <br/>
`REACT_APP_QRCODE_VERIFY_ENDPOINT` - The endpoint to verify the QR code <br/>
`REACT_APP_SCHEMA_URL` - The schema URL configuration in the agent file (agent.yml) <br/>
`REACT_APP_REMOTE_AGENT_API_KEY` - The API key for the agent ( this is not required if the agent is not protected by an API key), you can find it in the `agent.yml` at the line that declare the `apiKeyAuth` function <br/>
`REACT_APP_DEFAULT_AGENT_ID` - The agent ID for the agent <br/>

## Start the web server

To start the VCkit Demo Exlorer on you local, run this command

```bash
cd packages/demo-explorer && pnpm dev
```

Now you can see the VCkit Demo Explorer at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

## Common cases

:::warning
**IMPORTANCE**: Every time you make changes to the agent configuration, you need to remove your agent data on Explorer by hovering on the `Agent` profile in the top right corner, then selecting `manage` and clicking `Remove Agent` on your agent, it will automatically remove and load the new agent configuration.

### Change the API Key

- What is API key? You can read more about it [here](/docs/agent-configuration/config-agent-file#authentication-middleware-plugin)
- To change the API key, you need to update the `apiKey` argument in the `apiKeyAuth` function in the `agent.yml` file. After that, you need to update the `REACT_APP_REMOTE_AGENT_API_KEY` in the `.env` file. Then, you need to restart the API server and the Explorer. Remember remove the agent data on Explorer to load the new agent configuration.
