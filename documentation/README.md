# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service. 

### Testing your Build Locally

It is important to test your build locally before deploying it for production. Docusaurus provides a docusaurus serve command for that:

```bash
npm run serve
```

By default, this will load your site at http://localhost:3030/.
