Let's discover **VCkit in less than 10 minutes**.

## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through getting started with VCkit. There are 4 different ways that you can try VCkit. At the end of each way, you will know how to create a VC, verify it, etc.

The list of methods below has been arranged in order from simple to complex. Each method will have different advantages and disadvantages. We recommend starting with Demo Explorer so you can easily try out VCkit.

:::note
Each method includes steps to create a DID.

If you're already familiar with DIDs, feel free to proceed. If not, no worries! [Go here for a quick crash course](category/dids-and-didweb).
