## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality

-   There are no spelling mistakes
-   It reads well
-   For english language contributions: Has a good score on [Grammarly](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/grammarly.com) or [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)
-   For code contributions: It should minimally pass the automated code quality checks such as linting and tests, as well was having new tests of its own.

## Reviewing

:yellow_heart: Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did the best possible job with the knowledge they had at the time.

- [ ] Review the content for technical accuracy.
