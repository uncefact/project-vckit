## Version Bumping

   - Patch: Bug fixes (e.g., 1.0.1 → 1.0.2)
   - Minor: New features, backward-compatible (e.g., 1.0.2 → 1.1.0)
   - Major: Breaking changes (e.g., 1.1.0 → 2.0.0)

2. Update the version in:
   - `package.json` and `version.json` files.
   - Make sure all dependencies in `package.json` are up-to-date and compatible with the new version.
   - Make sure all dependencies in `version.json` are up-to-date and compatible with the new version.
   - Update documentation version if necessary.
   - Update API version if necessary.
